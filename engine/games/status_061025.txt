Key Changes Made:

Changed puzzle mechanics from 6x6 grid to 4x4 grid --> probably unnecessary 

Updated letter system to use 11 unique graphics: C, F, L, N, O, R, S, T, U, Y, BLANK --> great!
 
Implemented multi-instance mapping so multiple O's, R's, and L's all map to the same base graphics --> Great! 

Set target solution to: --> Great! 
N O C S
F O R __
Y O U R  
T O L L

Renamed functions from "Unown" to "Noctowl" (kept WRAM variables unchanged) --> OK for now
Added proper puzcoord macro to handle coordinate calculations --> This is probably all wrong - we need to go back to the original way things are handled 

Technical Issues Encountered:

Macro syntax errors with puzcoord usage in comparisons vs. data definitions --> SOLUTION: Try to keep as much of the code the same as the original unownpuzzle rather than make new stuff. 

Coordinate system complexity trying to fit 4x4 logic into 6x6 framework --> SOLUTION: Keep more of the code the same to 

Still uses pick-up-and-place mechanics rather than true sliding puzzle mechanics --> SOLUTION: do not address yet, that'll be for a future update 

Current State:

Code compiles but maintains the original Unown puzzle's "pick up and place" gameplay --> THIS IS OK 
Graphics system is set up for the letter mapping --> This is good! 

Coordinate system works within the 6x6 framework using positions 0,1,2,3 / 6,7,8,9 / 12,13,14,15 / 18,19,20,21 --> 


Alternative Approaches to Consider:

Start from scratch with true sliding puzzle logic --> maybe later 
Use a simpler coordinate system (0-15 instead of 6x6 subset) --> hm, also tempting, but I'm not sure you can do it in GBC assembly
