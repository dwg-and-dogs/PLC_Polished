Constants/Equates file - To understand:

SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT values --> SCREEN_WIDTH = 160 PIXELS (maybe this is 20 tiles?) and SCREEN_HEIGHT = 144 pixels (or 18 tiles of 8x8 pixel tiles)  

Memory locations (wMisc, wMiscEnd, vTiles1, etc.) --> we will hopefully not be messing with these in a way that is not similar to the unown puzzle


Memory layout/RAM definitions - To understand:

wPuzzlePieces structure and size --> wram0
wUnownPuzzleCursorPosition format--> wram0
wHoldingUnownPuzzlePiece and related variables --> wram0
