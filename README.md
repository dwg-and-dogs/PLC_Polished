## About Crystal Inheritance

Crystal Inheritance is a time-traveling adventure through Johto! 

When Ilex Forest is threatened, Celebi calls to you and Grandpa Kurt to help. Can you go back in time to save Johto's future? 

Use your knowledge of the world to craft pokéballs from new apricorns, discover Hisuian evolutions of Johto Pokémon, and explore Johto like never before. 

In historic Johto, you'll see the power-hungry Emperor Mejimi; Mejimi's three Generals Bobesh, Kensey, and Adrinna; and his standing army of brigaders. 

In modern Johto, you'll help Pryce confront Johto's gym leaders as they confront their own cynicism. 

Nothing is inevitable - what path will you choose?
