The only way to drop down is by navigating a maze in the middle two rooms. 

Those two left rooms are in pitch black with holes that will drop you down below if you step in them. 

The layout of the rooms is visible from the left/right rooms beside. You can light a candle in the cabins that illuminates the entire cabin, but the candle is only availabe on the outside rooms.
