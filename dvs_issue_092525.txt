; NPC tells you to put the #Mon you want in the first slot 
```
	; First: Store the DVs in case we don't actually want to do this 
	readmem wPartyMon1DVs+0     ; 
	writemem wOriginalDV1       ; 
	readmem wPartyMon1DVs+1     ; 
	writemem wOriginalDV2       ; 
	readmem wPartyMon1DVs+2     ; 
	writemem wOriginalDV3       ; 

```
; set the DVs to 16 and 16 
	loadmem wPartyMon1DVs+0, $ff
	loadmem wPartyMon1DVs+1, $ff
	loadmem wPartyMon1DVs+2, $ff
```
; ask  if you want them set this way. If you do, then show the species: 
	readmem wPartyMon1Species
	pokepic 0 ; shows the first pokemon, with colors varied for ffffff DVs
	pause 60
	cry 0
	waitsfx
	closepokepic
        ... 
       end 

and the code for undoing the changes if you don't want it: 
.UndoChanges:
	; Store the original DVs in temporary memory locations
	readmem wOriginalDV1       ; Writes hScriptVar to wOriginalDV1
	writemem wPartyMon1DVs+0     ; Reads value into hScriptVar
	readmem wOriginalDV2       ; Writes hScriptVar to wOriginalDV1
	writemem wPartyMon1DVs+1     ; Reads value into hScriptVar
	readmem wOriginalDV3       ; Writes hScriptVar to wOriginalDV1
	writemem wPartyMon1DVs+2     ; Reads value into hScriptVar
	end
