### Main theme to explore: What do we owe the future? 
### Minor themes: Generational alienation, technology, libertarian vs anarchic politics, religion, tradition
### Main message: Things are always changing, so it is good to raise people to view themselves as capable of adapting and thriving. 

### Plot summary: A time traveling adventure through Johto. Celebi assists the player as they and Kurt travel around Johto in the modern and historic times. In modern times, environmental disasters upend ways of life. In historic times, an outside force threatens the way of life as the emperor competes with an anarchic band for control of the region.

###Main Characters
# Place in the plot // Relation to the theme // Arc (if applicable)

# Kurt: Grandfather figure to POV character. Cantankerous and gets himself into trouble. Deep connection to nature. Extremely skeptical of technology. Master craftsmen of apricorns, a pokeball substitute. Extremely alienated from his son, as his son left him to pursue a career in the big city. Highly sentimental. Tough and aggressive. Publishes a secret magazine (the Ilex Excelsior, "When the tree rings, will you answer?") in a secret language that organizes opposition to Silph projects. // Believes he owes it to the future to create exactly his own upbringing and prevent any change, especially any technological change. // eventually sees the problem in his ways following several encounters with Rosin. 

# Rosin: Young man in Kurt's hometown who is raised to cut trees as a woodcutter but has more scientific interests. Sees that the Ilex forest is wilting (due to drought) and invents a distillation method to extract oils from apricorn trees. Scorned by Kurt and his father because they do not support his interests. Runs away from home when the Silph Co brings him in to work on a distillation method for seawater, believing this is part of his quest from Celebi. Eventually he realizes that Silph is just exploiting him without regard for environment. // Believes he only owes it to himself to thrive and has utter disdain for anyone who does not support him. // In the end, he decides to leave the Johto region, alienated by Kurt and his father. 

# Pryce: Idealistic friend of Kurt. Berates the gym leaders of Johto for abandoning their post. Regrets that he was unable to instill virtue in them. // Believes in the message of the game. // 

# Mejimi: Emperor of historic Johto. Initially uncertain because he knows that history is watching, he is manipulated by Adrinna into becoming a more forceful leader, tearing down tradition to exalt himself as a god with his pokemon Lugia and HoOh.  // Owes the future someone to look up to. // Initially uncertain he becomes more power hungry and selfish. He is a reincarnation of an ancestor. 

# Bobesh: historic general and overseer of the city of Gauldenrod. Harsh and mean spirited. // Believes that the world would be brutish and short (Hobbesian) without a strong disciplined leader. // No arc

# Kensey: historic general and overseer of the trader's landing, where the outsiders come with their superior technology. Coerces the nomads into becoming laborers to build new technology to compete with the outsiders. Bookish, bean counter, nerd. Technologist. // Believes that the world should be a continuous series of progress with little concern for what is left behind. 

# Adrinna: historic general and overseer of relations with the Hisuians and the Mt Mortar Mine. Objectivist philosopy. Cunning. Manipulates Mejimi into ending traditions, but usurps Mejimi when Mejimi simply replaces old traditions with new ones. Power hungry. Extremeley competitive. // Believes in survival of the fittest, and whatever is lost should not have existed in the first place. 

# Silph Co: Represented by Ostene, the CEO. Mega-Corporation that has taken over Johto. Bungled several environmental disasters, which are implied to be caused by it. They tend to be greedy but also provide higher living standards to people. Convinces Rosin that Silph support will help the forest. // Believe that they can build a better world by enabling innovators as a sort of accelerationist idea. // No arc

# Amos: historic anarachist who tries to unite the various elders (see below) to defy the emperor and drive out the outsiders. Through a series of mishaps, believes the player is actually on the side of Adrinna, and defies the player near the end of the story until confronted. // similar to pryce, he believes that everyone has something to offer, but has a limited range of acceptable values.  // Goes from believing that the player is against him to that the player is with him. 

# Samsara: Chief priestess to Emperor Mejimi. Has her eyes on history and is skeptical of Mejimi's path. Samsara's perspective could be expressed in pointed, memorable lines like: "The throne is not a seat of comfort, but an altar of service." "Your ancestors did not rule by taking, but by giving of themselves." Other religious figures might say:
A Shinto priest: "The land and the emperor are one. To take from one is to diminish the other."
A Buddhist monk: "Power grasped is power lost. Power given away returns tenfold."
An elder advisor: "Each emperor's sacrifice renews the covenant with our people."


###Plot
# Location, characters

1. Modern Azalea town: A coming of age ritual for the player and Rosin, in which celebi appears to ask for help from player and Kurt (and, by extension, Rosin). Celebi's home, Ilex Forest, is in danger of being cut down by Silph Loggers. The johto region is enduring a drought that may soon endanger the forest. Some say it is due to a lack of interest living in harmony with nature. Others say it is not. 

2. Modern Ilex Forest: player and Kurt drive out the loggers. Battle with Rosin, who explains that he is going to get Silph to fund his drive to find scientific/technological solution. Kurt convinces player to go back in time and eliminate steel types from entering Johto. 

3. Historic azalea and ilex ('anarres town'). The village is being overrun by silkworms which will tear down the forest. A character of Tammy has invented a new method of headbutting the trees to knock the worms down. Hollis, the elder (and deeply thematically similar to Kurt) refuses to let anyone else help because they don't appreciate as much. Hollis is convinved to let people help by the player and Tammy, realizing that he shouldn't be so protective of his place in the city. Counterpoint against perfection: Hollis protects the knowledge. First introduction to Amos. Hollis tells player and Kurt that some steel types are being brought in through the historic Olivine Port ("Trader's Landing"). 

4. Historic goldenrod ('gauldenrod'). Bobesh is taking over the city and projects his might with a stadium. A tradition in this city is a coming of age ritual in which the young person escorts an elder over a mountain route to an alpine lake -- essentially elder worship. The tradition is cancelled with bobesh arrival and annexation of the city into imperial control. The leader of Gauldenrod is Sandra, whose fatal flaw is being unwilling to give up on anyone. Sandra runs a tower that gives jobs to the disabled. (** Note -- need some kind of tragic or dark undertone to this tower to keep it from being too perfect. Probably, that youthful energy is spent on the weak, so large projects or ambitious ideas cannot be implemented, or maybe something that contrasts with Whitney's arc below) Bobesh tries to kill Sandra at the stadium with a Toxicroak, but Sandra is saved by the player. (There is an impotent rebel group in Gauldenrod trying to save her, but they can't for some reason -- probably, this should tie in to the fatal flaw**). In a secret meeting, Adrinna meets the player and commends them for their good work in taking down the foolish Bobesh. In the secret meeting Adrinna is setting the player up to betray Kurt in the end. Later, Sandra tells the player that it's not possible to get from gauldenrod to the landing, but she can send the player forward in time with Celebi. 

5. Modern goldenrod.  Whitney runs a talk show that is polarizing and keeps people from seeing the good in each other. The player encoutners an anarchic faction (organized by Kurt's magazine, unbeknownst to the player unless they're really paying attention) that tells the player: if you can battle whitney we can help you get out of the city. So the player sneaks into the radio tower. The player encoutners Rosin, who explains all the good that will be had when his distiller is commercialized by Silph. There is some fight about the best way to fulfill Celebi's vision:technological or not. Player battles Whitney and convinces her that the one-sided nature of her show is corrosize. The player travels along the modern equivalent of the alpine route (see Historic Gauldenrod) into Modern Violet City. 

6. Modern Violet City. Falkner is building a tower that will bang the bell of a pokemon called Bronzong being dug out of the ground. The ringing is meant to bring rain and eliminate the drought in Johto. Falkner has completely torn down the old temple to build his tower. Falkner is convinced through battle that building this tower robs the future of its water - the rain clouds have to come from some where. He's been exploiting the environmental crisis to gain clout with the citizens of Violet City. Falkner is a kind of parallel to Mejimi, in that both want to use the crisis of their time to gain clout. 

7. Modern Ecruteak. The player meets with the Kimono Girls, who tell a story of a historic time when a hero from historic azalea saved the region. The kimono girls tell hte player to go see the chronicler at the east tower. There is another encounter with Rosin and Ostene. Rosin tells the player that he has secured funding and is being given more responsibility, even though previous efforts (eg, the violet tower) didn't go according to plan. At the east tower, the player is transported back to historic ecruteak.

8. Historic ecruteak. Second meeting with adrinna, who gives the player a silver wing to foil Kensey's plan at the port. Adrinna is trying to make herself the most competent general to have more power. Another encounter with Amos, who sees adrinna give player the item. The player meets with Samsara, the chief priestess. Samsara has reservations about the emperor's increasing desire for power and disregard of traditions. Samsara discreetly helps the player get to the western port. Along the way, player encounters the coast nomads, whose beachhead was the first to be invaded by the outsiders with superior technology. The coast nomads are caught between the outsiders and the emperor, where the emperor promises protection in exchange for working to make poke balls. The conflict is such that the outsiders promise to trade with johto as long as they can have safe port, with the understanding that the outsiders will have priveleged trade status and that Johto will basically be a colony unless Johto does something about it.

9. Historic Olivine (traders landing). Home of the coast nomads. Coast nomads have a cult of youth - they travel between coast and some islands depending on the season, and those that are too old are left behind. They are deeply suspicious of maps or other technology because the islands they sail to are always shifting. Led by Barbeau. Kensey is urging Barbeau to get the nomads to help an outsiders' ship to port, otherwise war will occur between the outsiders and Johto. Barbeau believes that he will be saved by Lugia, guardian of the sea. Player makes a plan to acquire Lugia from modern times and bring it back in time to wreck the port. 

10. Modern whirl islands. Kurt acquires Lugia. Travel back in time through modern Cianwood. 

11. Historic olivine again. Kurt forces Lugia to attack the port. The outsiders' boats are ruined, and Lugia is so distraught that she flees to the historic whirl islands. (now there are two lugias in historic times --- the modern one brought by kurt, and the historic one held by the emperor, though technically this is the same one due to time travel) Barbeau is initially gleeful that the boat is gone, but suddenly realizes that Lugia may have perished, so attacks the player. Then, Kensey attacks the player for causing such mayhem. Kensey comes to terms with the loss of Lugia and resolves to find a way to navigate the sea without relying on her. Kensey retreats to the capital, telling the player that although this shipment of steel was stopped, another batch is being prepared at the mt mortar mine. Player goes forward in time. 


12. Modern Olivine. Chuck, a refugee from Cianwood following a devastating hurricane, is building an artificial intelligence by torturing the pokemon Slowking. Jasmine is unaware of this. The slowking requires a significant amount of purified water, which generates a lot of brine around the area and devastates the coastal ecology from the waste stream. Rosin is unsure of his invention being used this way and battles the player. Comes to a breaking point afterward, disgusted with his invention being used this way, even though he was assured by Silph that this would improve the world. Player climbs the lighthouse, at the top floor is jasmine and chuck and slowking. Jasmine is mad at chuck for forcing the pokemon to do these bad things, direct echo of kurt using lugia. First, player fights the slowking in its dream world. Then battles Chuck to stop him from using the slowking this way. Chuck resolves to change and consider the effects of his technology on the world. Jasmine resolves to ??? (** Note -- jasmine is this kind character, how can we make her make more sense in this conflict?) 
The player is able to get out of the city. Player heads to Pryce, who will help transport back in time near the mt mortar mine.

13. Modern Route 42. Player encounters Rosin in their final encounter. Rosin tells Kurt that his following of tradition is as natural as a silkworm sucking the energy from a tree. Kurt rebuffs him. Rosin leaves the region, abdicating his duty as the other gym leaders of Johto has, at least in Pryce's perspective. Abdicate is a KEY word in this story for the modern timeline. 

14. Modern Mahogany. Pryce agrees to lead the player to the shrine at the lake of rage. Along the way, Pryce dies of exhaustion, and regrets that he could not call the gym leaders to their duty. Player goes back in time. 

15. Historic lake of rage. Adrinna is trying to convince the Hisuians to join the emperor's army. He gifts the soldiers a gyarados, a notoriously tricky pokemon, and some of them fall for its appeal and defect from the Hisuian. Hisiuans are a neighboring area that has traditionally had good relations. Kanna, the Hisui leader, is obsessed with salmon mythology and the sacrifices made for the future, whereas the gyarados is a quick way to get stronger. The player tries to help Kanna but accidentally interrupts Kanna from trying to kill Adrinna, a scene witnessed by Amos. Adrinna thanks the player for the help and says things are going well at the mine, please come and see. Kurt reminds the player they have to stop the mine. 

16. Historic mahogany. Player goes to Amos' lair and explains the misunderstanding. They agree to attack the mine together. 

17. Historic mt mortar mine. Adrinna is about to capture Heatran, the most powerful steel type heart of the mountain. Adrinna had been tasked with getting gold for Mejimi statues but gave up this duty to go for Heatran, to the chagrin of Mejimi. Player defeats Adrinna and closes the mine, but it's too late, Mejimi has enough material to go through with the ceremony to become a God. Mejimi tasks his generals with protecting him . 

18. Historic capital. The player meets with the kimono girls of historic times and summons celebi and captures it. The player climbs the west tower to get to mejimi. Player is given an option by Adrinna: join her, and take over johto? If 'no', which is the intended option, then the player goes to the emperor. There is a thunderstorm approaching. The emperor is defeated, the player is rescued by HoOh, lightning strikes the tower, and Kurt reflects on his shortcomings and resolves to help the gym leaders return to their posts. If 'yes', then the player joins adrinna, takes down the empror, then defeats Kurt (killing Celebi) and is transported to a cutscene in the future in which the last remaining tree in Ilex Forest is cut down.
