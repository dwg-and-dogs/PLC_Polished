Artifact Summary: Hall of Fame Palette Bug
Problem Statement
In a custom Pokémon Crystal ROM, the Hall of Fame (HoF) sequence fails to display the correct color palettes for Pokémon (e.g., shiny or DV-varied palettes). Instead, it shows the default species palette, sometimes carrying over a single incorrect palette for all Pokémon in the sequence.

Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from a critical data handling bug in halloffame.asm where the Pokémon's Personality and DVs (Determinant Values) are mishandled during the save and load process.

Incorrect Data Saved: The HoF save structure (HOF_MON_LENGTH) allocates a 2-byte slot that is commented as being for "dvs". However, the function that saves the data, GetHallOfFameParty, incorrectly writes the 2-byte MON_PERSONALITY value into this slot, not the actual DVs.

Incorrect Data Loaded: The function that displays the HoF data, DisplayHOFMon, reads from that 2-byte slot and incorrectly loads the value back into the temporary variable wTempMonPersonality.

Uninitialized DV Buffer: The crucial memory buffer wTempMonDVs, which the color variation code (vary_colors.asm) reads from, is never populated with data from the HoF record. It retains stale data from previous operations, causing the incorrect palette generation.

Key Data Structures & Constraints
Any proposed solution must account for the distinct nature of DVs and Personality.

DVs (MON_DVS): This is a 3-byte value that determines minor color variations on the base palette. The three bytes correspond to HP/Atk, Def/Spd, and Sp.Atk/Sp.Def DVs.

Personality (MON_PERSONALITY): This is a 2-byte value where specific bits function as flags to determine if a Pokémon is shiny. This value is essential and must be saved and loaded correctly to preserve shininess.

The Conflict: The current HoF save structure only allocates a 2-byte slot, which is insufficient to store both the 3-byte DVs and the 2-byte Personality. The current code saves Personality but calls it DVs, creating the bug.
