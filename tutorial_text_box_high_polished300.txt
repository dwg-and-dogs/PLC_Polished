TODO: It may be possible to achieve this with text_asm.

1. Revise charmap.asm: 
-	charmap "<DAY>",    $07
+	charmap "<TEXTHIGH>", $07 ; New. Old:	charmap "<DAY>",    $07

2. Revise home/text.asm: 

```
	dw TextCommand_DECIMAL       ; $04 <NUM>
	dw TextCommand_PAUSE         ; $05 <PAUSE>
	dw TextCommand_SOUND         ; $06 <SOUND>
-	dw TextCommand_DAY           ; $07 <DAY>
+	dw TextCommand_SetHigher     ; $07 <TEXTHIGH>
	dw TextCommand_FAR           ; $08 <FAR>
	assert_table_length NGRAMS_START
```


```
+TextCommand_SetHigher:
+	bccoord TEXTBOX_INNERX, TEXTBOX_INNERY - 2 ; Set coordinates 2 lines higher
+	ret      

TextCommand_PROMPT_BUTTON::
```


3. Revise macros/scripts/text.asm:

```
+text_high: MACRO
+    db "<TEXTHIGH>" ; This inserts the byte for <TEXTHIGH> ($07)
+ENDM

text_asm: MACRO
	db "<ASM>"
ENDM
```

4. Remove all instances of text_day in data/text/common.asm and other areas of your repository: 

```
_BenFernText1::
	text_start
-	text_today
+	line "Have a good day!"
	done

SECTION "_GearTodayText", ROMX
_GearTodayText::
-	text_today
+	text " " ; space
	text_end
```

5. Example uses:

data/text/common.asm

```
_OakTimeWhatTimeIsItText::
	text_high
    text " Oak: " ; note the space before and after the text for better readability 
	next
	text_start 
	text "What time is it?"
	line "Example line,"
	cont "example continue,"
	
	para "example paragraph,"
	line "example line."
	done
```
