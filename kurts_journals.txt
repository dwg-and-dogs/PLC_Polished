Here are my suggestions for building dramatic tension through the six vignettes:
Journal 1 (Route 34) - Keep mostly as is, but add a subtle hint of future conflict:

Add a line about how "simple" things were then, or Kurt being pleased that his son was learning "the right way" to catch Pokémon

Journal 2 (Underground haircuts) - Introduce the first crack:

Add Kurt mentioning how he had to explain to other people why they still used apricorns when "new contraptions" were becoming popular
Maybe the barber asks about those "fancy new Poké Balls" and Kurt dismisses them

Journal 3 (Violet City school) - Show the son starting to question:

Add that the son asked about the new Poké Ball technology he was learning about in school
Kurt could mention feeling "concerned" about what they were teaching kids these days
The decorated apricorn could represent Kurt trying to make the old ways more appealing

Journal 4 (Olivine job) - The breaking point becomes clear:

Reveal that the dad's job was specifically working on Poké Ball manufacturing/research
Kurt could mention feeling "betrayed" or that his son was "abandoning everything I taught him"
The line about leaving the Cyndaquil behind gains new weight - the son knew Kurt wouldn't approve of what he was doing

Journal 5 (Missed festival) - The consequences of Kurt's disapproval:

Add that Kurt realizes his son is avoiding him because of their arguments about his work
The paint wearing off becomes symbolic of their deteriorating relationship, not just time

Journal 6 (Final meeting) - The apology and reconciliation:

Add Kurt reflecting that he drove his son away by being too rigid
Include an explicit apology: something like "I should have supported your dreams instead of clinging to mine"
The empty apricorn becomes a symbol of lost opportunities for understanding, not just nostalgia

This builds from innocent beginnings to ideological conflict to estrangement to regret and wisdom.
